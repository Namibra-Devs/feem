        <h2 class="research-title">Educational Support</h2>
        <p class="research-text text-left">
            According to the United Nations (UNICEF), there are more than 1.1 billion girls in the world
            today. There are 31 million girls of primary school age out of school. Of these, 17 million are
            expected to never enter school according to UNESCO. Also, UNESCO estimates that there
            are 34 million female adolescents out of school while almost a quaternary of young women
            ages 15-24 today numbering 116 million in developing countries who have never completed
            primary school and so lack the skills for work and two thirds of the 774 million illiterate
            people in the world are said to be females. The World Bank indicates that, in Ghana, the
            Gender Parity Index (GPI) for Gross Enrolment in tertiary education in Ghana stood at
            0.8471 percent in 2019, which is an indication that learning opportunities favoured more men
            than women (Sharma et al., 2021). UNICEF estimates that, if all women had secondary
            education there would be 49 percent fewer child deaths. Again, if all women had secondary
            education in Sub-Saharan Africa, South and West Asia, child marriages would have dropped
            to 64 percent. A powerful agent of change is an educated woman. Educate a woman you are
            sure that society will become better than it is already.
        </p>
        <p class="research-text text-left">
            Women and girls are the drivers of Sustainable development. Healthy educated and
            empowered women and girls will foster the change needed to create empowered communities
            and consequently a sustainable and peaceful future for all, as envisioned by the 2030 Agenda
            for Sustainable Development. Evidence shows that, when investment is made on women and
            girls, there is the creation of a ripple effect that yields multiple benefits, not only to the
            women and girls but also to families, communities and the country at large. Girls’ education,
            particularly at the secondary level, is the “magic bullet” for development and the most
            consistent driver of development goals. Girls’ education is one of the most powerful
            investments for development. Investing in girls can accelerate the fight against poverty and
            empower them to be valuable contributors to their communities and society at large.
        </p>
        <p class="research-text text-left">
            Educated young women are less likely to give birth in childhood, die during childbirth, more
            likely to send their children to school, and better able to protect themselves and their children
            from malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, trafficking, and sexual exploitation. An educated girl is more
            likely to get a job and earn a higher wage, and her nation’s economy is likely to benefit as a
            result and more, so an educated girl is more likely to enrol her children into school and can
            train and discipline them in the right manner. Education is one major form of empowering
            girls as through that they can understand a whole number of issues and are able to take
            decisions on their own. The initiative capitalizes on empowering young girls on education by
            encouraging them to reach higher levels in the educational ladder. The aim of the
            Organization is to ensure that some girls at the Junior High School and Senior High School
            
            levels in Ghana who are burdened financially be supported with some basic needs for their
            survival.
        </p>
        <p class="research-text text-left">
            More specifically, it is the mandate of the organization to support some of the girls at the
            Junior High School level with food and other basic needs to help them concentrate in school
            and pass their exam to enable them to move smoothly in their educational ladder. They will
            also be guided towards making the right career paths and moving towards the right direction
            which is going to lead them to greater heights. It must be stated that indeed some girls do go
            through a lot of struggles as the school feeding system by the Government is not extended to
            the Junior High School level. The Initiative therefore has it as part of its plans to take care of
            the feeding and basic needs of these girls to help them focus more on their academics. The
            aim at the end of the day is that these girls will be guided in the right way to help them
            develop mindsets that are all about moving and accelerating to the highest levels in their
            lives. As part of this agenda of supporting young women’s education is our scholarship
            scheme for young women in Ghana. The scholarship package includes the payment of fees, a
            semester stipend and a laptop. The first scholarship recipient is Christabel Ampomah, a
            daughter of a single mother. Christabel is first among her siblings making her way on the
            higher educational ladder and we believe she will be an agent of positive transformational
            change in her family and community.
