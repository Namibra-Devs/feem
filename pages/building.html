        <h2 class="research-title">Building Self Esteem</h2>
        <p class="research-text text-left">
          Self-esteem is a having a strong level of confidence and belief in oneself. It is often referred
to as wielding a high sense of personal belief and the inner conviction in your abilities
including your physical outlook. According to the Queensland Government (2024), having a
healthy self-esteem is when you generally feel good about yourself and your
accomplishments as well as feeling confident to try new things and challenge yourself.
Having a low self-esteem means that you do not believe that you are capable of anything and
that you do not deserve any form of special treatment. People with low self-esteem often have
the tendency to disbelief in their abilities and are often bullied and maltreated by people who
recognise their weaknesses. A low self-esteem can be very detrimental to many young people
especially girls as it places them in a vulnerable state of yearning to be recognised by a
particular group of people.
        </p>
        <p class="research-text text-left">
          For example, girls who belief that they are not physically attractive are often preys for
          predators who abuse them by making them think that no other individual will ever want them
          except they the predators. Girls caught up in the web of low self-esteem often conclude that
          their lives are dependent on their abusers hence have no where to go. Girls of that nature
          equally belief that nothing good could ever happen in their lives and they often fear to take
          initiatives or aspire for greatness. The organisation as part of its mandates, instils in young
          women a high-level self-esteem to believe in themselves, appreciate who they are and be
          filled with the conviction that they can achieve a lot of things. We have been doing this in
          some schools, and we hope to continue to hammer this message of self-belief. These moves
          we belief will deliver many young women out of toxic relations and help to protect them
          from coercive sexual relations.
