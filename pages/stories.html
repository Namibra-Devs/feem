          <p>
            In 7th January 2023 the Female Empowerment (FEEM) Initiative took it
            upon itself to fulfill a part of its missions by educating the young
            women (The UNFPA Young and Wise team) in the Feo Community in the
            Bongo District of the Upper East Region of Ghana on contraceptive
            methods as well providing them a means of livelihood thus liquid
            soap making. It was a two-pronged approach of empowerment. The first
            activity included giving them the knowledge on the types of
            contraceptive methods. Some of the girls acknowledged that they were
            hearing and seeing the types of contraceptive methods for the first
            time. At the end of the session on contraceptive methods, they all
            admitted that they had learnt something new and were interested in
            some of the methods of contraception. The second activity was on the
            skill training on liquid soap making. All girls developed the
            practical skill of liquid soap making. The team at FEEM urged them
            to sell the liquid soap produced on that day for the proceeds to be
            used for another production. In addition to that FEEM added the
            young women with a seed capital of 300.00 for them to add for the
            production of the liquid soap to be sold for some proceeds and
            profits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The profits are to be saved and used to support each other
            especially if some of them needed sanitary pads or urgently need to
            pay school fees or need assistance on any other important thing in
            future. The activities for the day ended well with majority of them
            expressing their joy and gratitude for the new knowledge they had
            gained and their readiness to put into practice everything learnt.
            The training on the liquid soap skill training led to the young
            women making their own production of the liquid soap.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ladies used the start-up to produce three basins of the soap of
            which they sold and made some profits out of the sale they made. The
            profits made were further on used to produce six basins of the
            liquid soap of which it has been sold to make more profits.

              "The journey was challenging, but the support made all the
              difference." the women had successfully produced and sold liquid
              soap, generating profits that enabled them to continue producing
              more. The initiative left them with newfound skills, financial
              independence, and a sense of empowerment, ready to apply their
              knowledge and support one another in the future. This event was a
              testament to the power of education and practical training in
              driving sustainable change in their lives.
